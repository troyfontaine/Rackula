## What _Is_ This

Plan your rack layout. Drag your devices in, move them around, export it. It runs in your browser. You can close the tab whenever you want.

## What It _Do_

- **Drag and drop devices** into your rack so you can frown at them
- **Real device images** so it actually looks like your gear, not sad grey boxes
- **Export to PNG, PDF, SVG** for your documentation or for printing and staring at
- **QR code sharing** - your layout lives in a URL, scan it and it just shows up

## Get Started

### **Use it right now:** [app.racku.la](https://app.racku.la)

### Selfhost with Docker

#### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/rackulalives/rackula:latest
```

#### Docker Compose

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rackulalives/rackula/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` and get after it.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rackulalives/rackula.git
cd Rackula && npm install && npm run build
```

Serve the `dist/` folder however you like. It's just files.

## Built With Claude

This project was built using AI-assisted development with Claude. I told it what to build and then said "no, not like that" a lot. The AI did a lot of typing. Commits with substantial AI contributions are marked with `Co-authored-by` tags because we're not going to pretend otherwise.

## Acknowledgements

Built for the [r/homelab](https://reddit.com/r/homelab) and [r/selfhosted](https://reddit.com/r/selfhosted) communities.

Device types and images ~~are stolen from~~ are compatible with the [NetBox devicetype-library](https://github.com/netbox-community/devicetype-library) because why reinvent that wheel.
